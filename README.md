# Drag and Drop Puzzle
## Scott Olthoff
**Prerequisites:** All you need is a web browser to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code>cd directoryname</code> - and run the imageAnim.html file in a browser window.

This project is a 4-piece, drag and drop puzzle created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. There are 4 puzzles that reset when you toggle between them. Drag and drop the puzzle pieces into their correct position. Be careful, you can only put 1 puzzle piece in a position so make sure that you place it properly!

**Bugs that require attention:**
1. You can place more than 1 puzzle piece in a position.
2. Toggling between puzzles does not reset the board.
